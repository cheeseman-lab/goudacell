Dataset: Senescent Cell Classification
Date: 2025-02-03
Experimenter: [Your Name]

Image Information:
- Microscope: DeltaVision
- Channels:
  1. DAPI (nuclear stain)
  2. p21 (senescence marker)
  3. SiR-DNA (cytoplasmic stain)

Label Definitions:
0 = Background (black)
1 = Non-senescent cells (red)
2 = Senescent cells (blue)
3 = Early senescent cells (green)
4 = Dead/damaged cells (yellow)

Notes:
- All images are max projections of 3D stacks
- Cells touching the image borders were excluded from labeling
- Segmentation performed using Cellpose
    - cyto3 model
    - cell diameter: 150 pixels
    - optional nuclear channel: DAPI channel
    - cellprob threshold: 0
    - flow threshold: 0.4
- Images were preprocessed by merging channels to RGB before segmentation

Quality Control:
- All labels were verified by at least one expert
- Cells with ambiguous phenotypes were excluded from labeling
- Segmentation errors were corrected using paint/erase tools before labeling
